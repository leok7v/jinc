"​JINKS - is what you say, when you and at least one other person,
simultaneously, say the same word(s). If you are first to say jinks, you are in
effect the jinks master, and the person who uttered the same word(s) and who is
now jinksed, cannot speak, until someone says their name in full. Uttering words
while jinksed however, will result in double jinks, triple jinks and so on and
so forth, for each additional word spoken."​
